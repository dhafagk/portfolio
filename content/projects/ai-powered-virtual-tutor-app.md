This project explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education through the development of an AI-based Virtual Tutor application. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques implemented via the OpenAI GPT API, enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Prompt Engineering to improve learning accuracy, engagement, and interactivity.

The research follows the ADDIE framework (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation), a structured model widely adopted in educational technology development.

#### Core AI Technologies
