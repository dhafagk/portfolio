SriCandy is a mobile e-commerce application that offers a seamless and luxurious jewelry shopping experience. The app allows users to explore curated collections, view product details in high resolution, and enjoy an intuitive shopping interface optimized for performance and aesthetics.

As the Frontend Developer, I was responsible for designing and implementing the entire mobile user interface (UI) using React Native, ensuring the app feels modern, fast, and responsive across both Android and iOS devices.

#### My Responsibilites & Contributions

1. Built responsive UI components and page layouts based on product requirements and Figma designs.
2. Implemented smooth navigation flows, from home screen → product detail → checkout.
3. Integrated API endpoints for product listings, categories, and user actions.
4. Integrated with third party library such as Paypal to make payment.
5. Focused on UX optimization, such as faster loading times, smooth transitions, and accessibility.
6. Collaborated with backend developers and designers to align functionality with business goals.

Building SriCandy strengthened my skills in mobile UI development, component-based architecture, and cross-platform optimization. It’s a great example of turning design into a fully functional, production-ready shopping app using React Native.
