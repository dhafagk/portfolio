![Kamisaha Wordpress Theme](/images/projects/kamisaha-wordpress-theme/1.jpg)

Kamisaha is a fully custom-built WordPress theme designed for anime streaming. Unlike most pre-made templates, this project was developed from scratch, giving full control over performance, SEO structure, and UI flexibility. The platform allows users to browse, stream, and search anime titles in an intuitive and visually engaging interface.

#### My Responsibilites & Contributions

1. Developed a custom WordPress theme with unique layouts, components, and dynamic content structures.
2. Built front-end templates (home, anime list, detail, and player pages) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Integrated WordPress REST API to dynamically fetch anime data and manage posts efficiently.
4. Optimized site for speed and SEO, ensuring fast load times and higher visibility in anime-related searches.
5. Implemented responsive design for smooth streaming experiences across desktop and mobile.
6. Added custom fields and taxonomies for genre filtering, episode management, and video embedding.
