Satu Global Investama is an investment and financial advisory company that specializes in corporate finance, IPO, mergers & acquisitions, and business restructuring. To establish a strong online presence and communicate professionalism, the company required a modern, responsive, and credible landing page that represents its brand identity while maintaining performance and accessibility.

As the Frontend Developer, I designed and implemented the entire landing page using Next.js for server-side rendering and Chakra UI for a clean, responsive component library. The result is a fast, elegant, and SEO-optimized website that delivers a professional corporate impression across all devices.

#### My Responsibilites & Contributions

1. Built the landing page layout, including the hero section, services overview, company profile, and contact information using Next.js + Chakra UI.
2. Ensured the website adapts beautifully across devices using Chakra’s responsive props and flexbox system.
3. Applied semantic HTML tags, meta configurations, and server-side rendering for better search ranking.
4. Used image optimization, lazy loading, and clean code structure to ensure fast page loads.
5. Designed modular components (Navbar, Footer, Card, Section Blocks) for scalability and easy maintenance.
